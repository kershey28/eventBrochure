Project assigned to: Kershey Carino

1. The theme is on Climate technology, so you may want to use something relevant to this topic, such an image of earth/tree/green development/ environment protection etc,.

2. You can create a logo (or download an existing logo which you think is good) and then make the rest of the element (such as color, shape) in harmony with the logo

3. You can refer to the posters/brochures/banners from other tradeshows or conferences
